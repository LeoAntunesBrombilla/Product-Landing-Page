      A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of
      arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
      Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of
      operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an
      extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the
      hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
      required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer
      system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are
      connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer
      cluster. Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of
      industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose
      devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as
      industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose
      devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones.
      The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of
      other computers and their users. Early computers were only conceived as
      calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the
      abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial
      Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious
      tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms.

      More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations
      in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating
      machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor
      transistors in the late 1940s were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET
      (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip technologies
      in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer
      revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power and versatility of computers
      have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts
      increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the
      Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.
      Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing
      element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a
      microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically
      semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic
      and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the
      order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices
      include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices
      (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform
      both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow
      information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the
      result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
